### 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Full Stack Engineer & Software Architect** with deep expertise in **Angular** and **.NET (C# / ASP.NET Core)** — building **scalable, production-grade systems** for enterprise clients across **Fintech, Healthcare, AI, ESG, and Blockchain** sectors.  

As a **Top Rated Plus Freelancer on Upwork (Top 3% globally)** with **5⭐ reviews across all contracts**, I pride myself on delivering software that’s not only technically excellent but also drives real business value.  

I specialize in designing **clean, modular architectures** that follow **SOLID principles**, **design patterns**, and **reactive programming (RxJS)** — delivering code that’s not only powerful, but **maintainable and future-proof**.

> **Note:** 🚫 *My repositories aren’t public — all production code is under company GitHub accounts and strict NDAs.*  
> 💼 *Every line of code I write is for production apps that make money — not for display!* ⚡   
> 📘 However, I’ve prepared detailed .md repositories that explain the architecture, technologies, and business logic behind my major apps.
