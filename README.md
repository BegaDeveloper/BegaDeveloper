I build software. I ship it. And I make sure it actually works in production.

From backend logic and APIs to Angular frontends and cloud infrastructure — I handle the full stack.<br>
Most of my work is in Angular + .NET, building scalable systems for Fintech, Healthcare, AI, ESG, and Blockchain products.

I’m also a Top Rated Plus freelancer on Upwork (Top 3%), and I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that teams can build on — not just “make it work” solutions.

I enjoy turning complex ideas into clean systems, solving real problems, and building software that’s easy to extend, scale, and maintain.

> **Note:** 🚫 *My repositories aren’t public — all production code is under company GitHub accounts and strict NDAs.*  
> 💼 *Every line of code I write is for production apps that make money — not for display!* ⚡   
> 📘 However, I’ve prepared detailed .md repositories that explain the architecture, technologies, and business logic behind my major apps.
